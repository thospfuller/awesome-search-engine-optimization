- [@ConnorShowler: Sneaky Backlink #49: ](https://twitter.com/ConnorShowler/status/1775722543179018451) from [HashNode](https://hashnode.com/) Software developers who manage their own blogs may benefit from earning a backlink from HashNode (HN) since it should be contextually relevant; HN may also serve as an excellent platform for cross-posting content (requires further investigation).
- [@ConnorShowler: Build backlinks with Evernote.](https://twitter.com/ConnorShowler/status/1734389868778738175) I've only looked into this idea breifly however so far it makes sense and may be a good idea too but that's TBC. Evernote is not free however considering what other solutions in this space cost it could be a very attractive option. 
- [@ConnorShowler: Link Tree landing pages](https://twitter.com/ConnorShowler/status/1728252631154319609) Not confirmed however if everyone is doing this the backlink is probably not worth much, if anything at all. We can look at this from a different angle though and that is how many backlinks a site like [Link Tree](https://linktr.ee/) has and, as of 25.Nov.2023, this is 162M from 551K referring websites as per [ahrefs website authority checker](https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker).
- [@illyism: I got 2400 backlinks from 170 domains in 1 week](https://twitter.com/illyism/status/1725092535796642166) Possibly gray hat SEO so I'm not sure about this one and requires further investigation.
